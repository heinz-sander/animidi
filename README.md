# AniMIDI
Make Animusic-style videos with Blender and Python.

## Introduction
Animusic is a series of animated music videos produced by Wayne Lytle and David Crognale. Each video contains 3D computer-generated instruments which play themselves in time to the music, which was accomplished by a bunch of custom software.

This Python library accomplishes the same thing. You can use it to create scripts in Blender which animate your virtual instruments along to a MIDI file you provide.

If that sounds daunting, that's because it is! You have to know both Blender and Python, as well as the working relationship between them. If you'd rather use something simpler, I'd suggest [MIDIAnimator](https://github.com/jamesa08/MIDIAnimator), which does the same thing.

More tutorials coming soon. (8 Jan 2025)
